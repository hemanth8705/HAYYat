      "headline": "No trade deals with a gun to our head: Piyush Goyal on India-US trade talksThis special report covers Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal's firm message on India's approach to international trade negotiations, particularly regarding the United States. Speaking at the Berlin Global Dialogue, Mr. Goyal made it clear that India will not be rushed into agreements. He stated, 'we do not do deals in a hurry, and we do not go ahead and sign any deals with deadlines or with a gun to our head'. The minister emphasized that for India, trade deals are not merely about tariffs or market access but are long-term partnerships built on trust and mutual respect between nations. This stance comes amid ongoing trade discussions with both the US and the European Union, where India is advocating for fair and equitable agreements that benefit its businesses and economy in the long run."
