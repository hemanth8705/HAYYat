      "headline": "Delhi Air 'Not Safe': Danish Shuttler Pulls Out Of India Open Citing Delhi's 'Poisonous' AirThis news bulletin addresses the alarming levels of air pollution in Delhi and its impact on international sporting events. A prominent Danish badminton player has withdrawn from the India Open, citing hazardous air quality in the national capital. The speaker notes that the athlete's decision was not based on injury or scheduling but on the fact that the 'air in the national capital is simply not safe.' The programme highlights the embarrassment of a global sporting event being deemed unfit for athletes due to breathing risks. The shuttler reportedly stated that Delhi is 'not the place to host tournaments under such conditions,' a comment the speaker describes as an indictment of years of apathy and inaction. The report concludes by calling the situation a national shame, as the city's air turns poisonous every winter, posing a daily risk to residents and now deterring international competitors."
