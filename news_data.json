On Tuesday, repeated protests by opposition MPs over the same issues brought both Houses to a standstill, stalling proceedings in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for the second consecutive day. In the Lok Sabha, opposition leaders stormed the Well at 11 am, waving placards and shouting slogans to press for the withdrawal of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the electoral rolls in Bihar. Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan urged them to let the Question Hour proceed, but his plea went unheeded, forcing Speaker Om Birla to adjourn the House till noon. Each time the Lower House reassembled, similar disruptions erupted. The Rajya Sabha also witnessed multiple adjournments following uproar over the two prime issues and was ultimately adjourned for the day shortly after it met post-lunch at 2 pm without conducting any business.
