Brende highlights that despite global tensions, including potential friction between Europe and the US over Greenland, global growth remains resilient at over 3%. He notes that 'the Ukraine war possibly could end this year' if there is sufficient willingness for a solution. The discussion covers India's rising economic influence, with Brende describing India as a 'US$10 trillion economy pretty soon' that contributes 20% to global growth. He addresses the 'Trumpian world order,' suggesting that while media focuses on the 'noise,' quiet bilateral cooperation continues to drive the global agenda. Brende identifies escalating conflict in the Gulf, debt bubbles, and 'black swan' events like cyber warfare as the primary risks to global stability in 2026. He emphasizes that the WEF remains an impartial platform where competing powers like the US, China, and India can engage in essential dialogue."

Gaurav Sawant notes, 'So the ICC has read the riot act to Bangladesh,' highlighting the ultimatum that the team must either participate or be replaced by Scotland.
