This postponement impacts scheduled negotiations that were crucial for preventing additional tariffs. A 50% tariff on Indian goods is set to take effect from August 27. Currently, a 25% tariff is already in place, impacting exporters. The deferment of the meeting does not signify cancellation, but rather a delay. Reasons for the delay could be operational or related to geopolitical outcomes. \"A 50% tariff will be imposed on us from August 27 in totality.\" The BTA deal is anticipated by the end of September or October, with expectations for a meeting by the end of August, contingent on geopolitical developments."
