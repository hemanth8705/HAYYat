There's one really good line I learnt from Rahul (Dravid) bhai. He always told me one thing: 'Rishabh, no matter what happens, try to be the same person when you score a hundred and when you score a zero,'\" Pant said.\r\n\r\n\"I think, as an athlete, that's the hardest thing to do \u2014 to remain who you are. Emotions sometimes get the better of you, but that line always stays with me. So personally, I try that. Whether I score zero or a hundred, I want to be the same guy. Maybe when I get out, it hurts more. I don't enjoy scoring runs as much as I feel the pain of getting out,\" the wicketkeeper-batter concluded."
