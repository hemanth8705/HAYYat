      "headline": "Nitin Srivastava On Pakistan's U-Turn: PCB Names T20 World Cup Squad After ICC Sanction WarningOn this report, Nitin Srivastava discusses the Pakistan Cricket Board's (PCB) decision to end its boycott threat and name a 15-member squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup in India. The shift comes after a stern warning from the ICC regarding potential sanctions, including the loss of PSL contracts and bilateral series. Nitin Srivastava notes, 'Pakistan was never in that kind of mind frame that they will boycott. It was just a threat to tell ICC that we can actually do that.' The transcript highlights that while Pakistan initially backed Bangladesh's protest against travelling to India, the fear of financial and sporting isolation forced a move toward compliance. While Bangladesh has been replaced by Scotland due to their refusal to play in India, Pakistan will play their matches in Colombo. The discussion underscores that the ICC will not tolerate 'petty politics' or moral support for boycotts that lack a valid security basis, ensuring the tournament proceeds with Pakistan's participation."
