The narrative explores the deep-rooted practices of Bhuta Kola, the worship of local spirits, and the significance of the deities Panjurli and its companion, Guliga. The film showcases Bhuta Kola, which 'literally means spirit play in Tulu and it's a ritualistic performance honoring Bhutas, local spirits or deities who are believed to be protectors of the land, villages and families.' The report explains the mythology behind Panjurli, a boar spirit often associated with Lord Vishnu's Varaha avatar, seen as a powerful protector of agriculture and villages. It also touches upon other spirits within the vast Tuluva pantheon, like the fierce Guliga, the guardian Bhairava, and Kallurthi, celebrating the intricate relationship between humanity, nature, and the divine that has thrived for centuries."
