      "headline": "India Today's Anirban Sinha Roy Reports: VIPs Hijack Messi Event in Kolkata, Fans StrandedIn this Special Report, India Today's Anirban Sinha Roy reports on the chaotic scenes at Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium during Lionel Messi's historic visit. The journalist highlights how 'Neta monkeys' and their associates, including actress Subhashree Ganguly, hijacked the event, leaving ordinary fans stranded outside. Roy notes that while VIPs and their families managed to click photos with the Argentine legend, genuine ticket-holders were denied a glimpse. The broadcast also covers the political fallout, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) demanding the resignation of the West Bengal Sports Minister over the mismanagement. The report underscores the stark contrast between the 'passion' of the fans and the 'privilege' of the ruling class."
