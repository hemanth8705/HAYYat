I think we don't really discuss the skills that we have,\" Rashid said at the pre-match press conference.\r\n\r\nDespite playing at what is effectively his home ground with the Gujarat Titans, the Afghan spinner dismissed suggestions that familiarity would give his side an advantage.\r\n\r\n\"To be honest, no one around the world will tell you how the wicket will behave before the game. To put those things in the mind a lot, I think it affects you mentally as well,\" he explained.\r\n\r\nRashid also played down talk of his impending 700-wicket milestone, insisting his focus remains solely on team success. \"I have not kept any target in my mind that I will take 700 wickets and stop.\""

You sort of almost withhold quite a lot and withdraw because you don't want to feel\u2014you've had your go, you're out the way now,\" Buttler said.\r\n\r\nThe wicketkeeper-batter revealed he spoke to Joe Root about navigating similar emotions when Root returned to the Test side under Ben Stokes' captaincy. \"He was stood at slip and I was keeping wicket. We had five or ten minutes just talking about it, how different it is,\" Buttler explained.\r\n\r\nHowever, encouragement from current captain Harry Brook and head coach Brendon McCullum has helped Buttler embrace his role as a senior voice within the group."
