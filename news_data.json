After hours of heavy rainfall, a road caved in, swallowing an entire truck. The accident speaks volumes about the crumbling infrastructure in the area. The incident took place on a service road near the SPR road, where the truck driver, Satpal, was making a left turn. The road suddenly gave way, causing the back of the truck to sink. Eyewitnesses report that the ground beneath appeared hollow, with water continuously flowing underneath. The collapse happened swiftly, leaving no time for reaction. Fortunately, the driver and his associate managed to escape unharmed. The area has now been cordoned off and traffic diverted. This incident highlights the poor construction quality and infrastructure issues plaguing the region, especially during monsoons."
