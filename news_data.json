      "headline": "LIVE: Counting of votes for Maharashtra municipal elections 2026 from 10 am todayMaharashtra Civic Body Election Result Live Updates: After nearly nine years, Maharashtra held civic body elections across 29 municipal corporations, including key urban centres such as Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Nagpur, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Nashik. With polling completed on Thursday and an overall turnout of 46\u201350 per cent, attention has now shifted to counting, scheduled to begin at 10 am today. The elections featured several high-profile political contests. The coming together of the Thackeray brothers to take on the BJP-led alliance, including Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena, emerged as a major talking point. In Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, members of the Pawar family joined forces to defend their traditional strongholds. Notably, despite being on opposite sides at the state level, the NCP and NCP (SP) put aside differences for the municipal polls and jointly fielded candidates, adding another layer of intrigue to the results.

Residents in Tehran have begun resuming routine activities, even as uncertainty persists amid a prolonged state-imposed communications blackout that has largely cut the country off from the outside world for more than a week. Human rights groups say more than 2,600 people have been killed since the unrest began, with thousands more detained. While the US has refused to rule out military action and imposed fresh sanctions on Iranian officials accused of directing the crackdown. Donald Trump has warned of \"grave consequences\" if killings continue, while saying he has been told executions have been halted. Iran, for its part, has denied plans for hangings.
