Opposition protests stalled proceedings in both Houses, forcing Prime Minister Narendra Modi to skip the Lok Sabha and instead reply to the President's address in the Rajya Sabha. Outside Parliament, Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi touched off a row by branding Congress-turned-BJP MP Ravneet Bittu a \"traitor\" for switching parties. With most of last week's business lost to disruptions, opposition floor leaders met at the office of Rajya Sabha Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge ahead of today's sitting. The first phase of the Budget Session is set to conclude on February 13. Parliament will then adjourn for a recess before resuming on March 9. Stay with IndiaToday.in for latest updates"
