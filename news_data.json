This follows five previous rounds of talks. Prime Minister Narendra Modi responded to the trade situation by promising to protect local interests and stating his government would not let farmers, small entrepreneurs, or animal breeders be harmed. He also promoted a 'swadeshi' philosophy of encouraging products made in India. US President Donald Trump, while noting his friendly relationship with PM Modi, expressed disappointment over India buying Russian oil but affirmed the special relationship means there is \"nothing to worry about.\""
