All eyes are on her announcements, which are likely to focus on tax relief for the middle class, continued focus on infrastructure spending, and maintaining fiscal discipline. This is due to a projected slowdown in GDP growth, persistently high inflation and sluggish consumption. Tax reforms, including an increase in the basic exemption limit and a potential new tax bracket under the new regime, are among the key expectations. But ticking all the boxes will be tough, given the fact that achieving a fiscal deficit target of 4.5 per cent remains a challenge. Will the Finance Minister manage to strike the right balance?
