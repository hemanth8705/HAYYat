      "headline": "Can India turn its data edge into global AI leadership? Experts debateAt the India Today AI Summit, the conversation moved beyond algorithms and valuations to a more fundamental question: power. As panellists noted, artificial intelligence runs not just on data and chips but on massive, uninterrupted energy supply to fuel data centres and high-performance computing. With AI workloads rising globally, advanced economies such as the United States and parts of Europe are already grappling with grid stress and delays in expanding generation capacity. Against this backdrop, speakers argued that India's relative energy sufficiency and ongoing renewable expansion could offer a strategic edge. India has added significant power capacity in recent years and is pushing solar, wind and green hydrogen projects, positioning itself to meet rising digital infrastructure demand. If managed well, this energy readiness could help India scale domestic data centres, strengthen data sovereignty and even emerge as a competitive AI hub, turning power security into economic advantage in the global AI race."
