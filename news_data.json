Zelenskyy will be joined by leaders from the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Finland, the EU and NATO at the White House following Trump's earlier talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 15. While the Trump-Putin talks last week yielded no ceasefire, Russia reportedly agreed to let the US and its allies propose a security guarantee for Ukraine, similar to NATO's collective defence principle. It is expected that Trump may pressure Zelenskyy into accepting a deal favourable to Moscow. Zelenskyy, however, has maintained Ukraine will not cede territory but remains open to working with Trump on a lasting peace agreement. Follow indiatoday.in for all Live Updates."
