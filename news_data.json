      "headline": "Shami vs Agarkar: Pacer Slams 'No Communication' Over Aus Tour SnubThis special report focuses on the escalating controversy between senior Indian pacer Mohammed Shami and the BCCI's selection committee, headed by chief selector Ajit Agarkar. Shami is quoted in the bulletin as saying, 'The Indian team did not communicate with me regarding fitness. I am not the one who should inform them about my fitness.' The pacer has publicly questioned his exclusion from the upcoming tour of Australia, stating that if he is fit enough to play four-day Ranji Trophy matches for Bengal, he should be considered for the 50-over format. This comes after Agarkar had reportedly raised concerns about Shami's lack of consistent match practice. Shami refutes any fitness concerns, asserting he is ready to play for the Indian team whenever called upon, creating a standoff between the veteran player and the national selectors."
