The controversy ignited after Naqvi, who is also Pakistan's Interior Minister and PCB Chairman, refused to part with the trophy, instead urging 'that there be a presentation ceremony at which a BCCI officer, office bearer that is, and a participating player of the Indian team collect the trophy directly from him'.

Following the refusal, the BCCI has warned it will escalate the matter to the International Cricket Council (ICC) if the trophy is not handed over."
