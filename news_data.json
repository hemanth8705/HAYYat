At the time of the toss, both captains reportedly refused to shake hands, a move attributed to the ongoing diplomatic tensions between the two nations. The programme discusses how this 'no handshake policy' is becoming a new form of weaponisation in cricket, reflecting broader political protests on the field. The speaker notes that this trend has intensified since 'Operation Sindoor', citing previous instances where Indian and Pakistani captains, including Harmanpreet Kaur and Fatima Sana, avoided the customary gesture during the Asia Cup and ICC events. The discussion emphasizes that 'politics is now seeping into the game and it has now completely taken over when it comes to India matches', extending beyond the traditional India-Pakistan rivalry to include India-Bangladesh encounters. The segment explores the implications of these diplomatic frictions on the future of international cricket and the role of governing bodies like the BCCI and ICC in managing such on-field incidents."
