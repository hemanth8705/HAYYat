The intense clash ended with a Trump-brokered ceasefire. Netanyahu maintained that Israel had successfully disrupted Iran's nuclear ambitions and pledged to respond forcefully to any future threats. While Iran continued to deny pursuing nuclear weapons, it agreed to halt retaliatory actions if Israel ended its airstrikes. The truce came after Trump ordered bunker-buster strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, saying they crippled Tehran's capabilities. CIA Director John Ratcliffe backed this, saying the damage would take Iran years to repair. Follow indiatoday.in for live updates."
