      "headline": "Sourav Ganguly Advises Team India to Play on Good Pitches and Win Tests in 5 DaysThis special report delves into the intense debate over India's Test cricket pitch strategy, featuring analysis from former India captain Sourav Ganguly and cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar. The discussion addresses whether India should prepare turning tracks from day one or opt for good batting pitches that last longer, following a recent loss on a spin-friendly wicket. Sourav Ganguly, the current President of the Cricket Association of Bengal, offered his advice, stating the team should 'win test matches in 5 days, not in 3 days'. The programme explores the differing philosophies, with Gavaskar suggesting curators should be left alone to prepare balanced surfaces, while Ganguly advocates for playing on good pitches against all opponents to build a resilient team."
