The announcement was made by the Prime Minister from the ramparts of the Red Fort. These reforms are seen as a Diwali gift for the middle class. Key changes include the removal of the 12% GST slab and rate rationalisation for health and life insurance policies. The government aims to reduce the GST on most items currently in the 12% slab to 5%. This move is expected to make essential items such as footwear, bags, clothes, and toothpastes more affordable. The government is addressing concerns about inflation and the rising cost of living. Feedback regarding health insurance, which impacts the common person, has also been considered. The meetings in September are crucial for approving these changes, with implementation anticipated before Diwali. The Finance Ministry and state finance ministers have been involved in the process."
