While highlighting a 'stupendous 2025' marked by major reforms like GST simplification and the Jan Vishwas Bill, the report warns that India enters the new year 'playing on a strong economic pitch, but also on a sticky wicket'. Key challenges identified include the ongoing trade impasse with the US, punitive 'Trump tariffs' of 50%, and a depreciating rupee which breached the 91 mark against the dollar. The programme notes that while GDP growth remains robust at 8%, high food inflation and sluggish job creation persist. With five state elections due in 2026, the report also flags concerns over rising state debts due to populist spending, even as all eyes turn to the upcoming Union Budget in February to restore confidence and boost private investment."

Earlier, Trump shared a picture of a handcuffed and blindfolded Maduro aboard a US warship that was heading towards New York to face a criminal trial. Several countries, including those in Latin America, Europe, Russia and China condemned US's strikes on Venezuela and called for de-escalation of tensions. The strikes in Venezuela come amid heightened pressure from the US, which has recently targeted alleged drug-smuggling boats, even as Caracas signalled openness to talks on counter-narcotics cooperation.
