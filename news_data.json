      "headline": "Delhi Runs in Killer Smog: 'Nothing Short of Stupidity,' Warns ExpertThis special report focuses on the extreme health risks of outdoor exercise in Delhi's severe air pollution, with insights from medical expert and marathon runner, Dr. Agni Kumar. He stated that holding mass running events in these conditions is 'nothing sort of short of stupidity to be holding such mass marathons.' Dr. Kumar explains that while exercising, a person's air intake can increase from 5-6 litres per minute to as high as 100 litres, exponentially increasing the volume of toxic smog inhaled. This, he warns, is equivalent to smoking a vast number of cigarettes and significantly raises the risk of chronic lung diseases like COPD, emphysema, and asthma. The discussion also touches upon why people, influenced by herd mentality, continue to run and cycle in AQI levels of 400, sometimes in government-organised events."
