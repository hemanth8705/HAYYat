While highlighting a 'stupendous 2025' marked by major reforms like GST simplification and the Jan Vishwas Bill, the report warns that India enters the new year 'playing on a strong economic pitch, but also on a sticky wicket'. Key challenges identified include the ongoing trade impasse with the US, punitive 'Trump tariffs' of 50%, and a depreciating rupee which breached the 91 mark against the dollar. The programme notes that while GDP growth remains robust at 8%, high food inflation and sluggish job creation persist. With five state elections due in 2026, the report also flags concerns over rising state debts due to populist spending, even as all eyes turn to the upcoming Union Budget in February to restore confidence and boost private investment."
