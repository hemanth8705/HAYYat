      "headline": "Baramati Live: Ajit Pawar leads NCP (SP)'s Yugendra Pawar with more than 11,000 votes Baramati Election Result 2024 Live: The vote counting for the high-octane Baramati Assembly constituency will begin at 8 am, marking the culmination of an intense family showdown between Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and his nephew, Yugendra Pawar, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) candidate.\r\n\r\nBaramati has drawn significant attention since the MVA announced Yugendra, from the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), as its candidate. The race pits two family members against each other, echoing a similar rivalry seen during previous Lok Sabha elections.\r\n\r\nAjit Pawar, seeking a seventh term as MLA, has campaigned under challenging circumstances, aiming to secure victory after a disappointing Lok Sabha performance. His campaign included an emotional appeal to voters, emphasising personal connections and his long-standing service to the constituency.  \r\n\r\nAdding a personal touch to his campaign, Ajit Pawar's mother joined him on the trail, symbolising family unity and support amidst factional disputes within the NCP.\r\n\r\nWith political dynamics shifting and personal stakes high, all eyes are on Baramati as the results could redefine the region's political landscape."
