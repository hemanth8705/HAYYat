The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is demanding the handover of the silverware after the Indian team refused to accept it from Naqvi, who is also Pakistan's Interior Minister, following their victory. BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia told India Today, 'We have written to ACC to give the trophy to the champion team. We are awaiting a response.' The board has made it clear that if the ACC does not comply, it will escalate the matter to the International Cricket Council (ICC). This unprecedented situation has garnered support for the BCCI from the cricket boards of Sri Lanka and Afghanistan, further intensifying pressure on the ACC."
