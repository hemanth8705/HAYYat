The interview delves into the evolution of her character, which is inspired by the journey of an uneducated woman thrust into power, drawing parallels to figures like former Chief Minister Rabri Devi. Qureshi shares insights into the upcoming fourth season of the show, her own career trajectory from 'Gangs of Wasseypur' to pan-Indian cinema, and her views on the need for more female role models in both fiction and real-life politics.
