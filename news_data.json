The tension escalated after the ICC replaced Bangladesh with Scotland, following Bangladesh's refusal to play in India. Vikrant Gupta notes, 'The moment they do that, their cricket is finished,' highlighting that Pakistan lacks a valid alibi for a boycott. The transcript details potential 'never-before sanctions' including the denial of NOCs for foreign players in the PSL, loss of ICC revenue, and total cricketing isolation. Gupta describes Pakistan's stance as 'geopolitical posturing' to align with Bangladesh, predicting that despite the current drama involving PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, Pakistan will ultimately participate in the tournament to avoid financial and institutional destruction."
