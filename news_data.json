But an hour later, the BJP made a huge turnaround, entering into a neck-to-neck contest with the Congress before taking a slender lead, with the party touching the majority mark.

However, it faces a formidable challenge from the Congress, which is seeking to make a comeback to the northern state after a decade. Most exit polls, including India Today CVoter exit poll, predicted a huge win for the Congress, suggesting that the party is likely to get 50-58 seats while the BJP may get 20-28 seats.
