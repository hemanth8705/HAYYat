      "headline": "Jallikattu 2026: Pramod Madhav On Strict Rules As 1,000 Bulls Enter The ArenaOn this Special Report, India Today Senior Correspondent Pramod Madhav reports from the ground as the traditional bull-taming sport, Jallikattu, begins in Tamil Nadu. Marking the commencement of the Pongal harvest season, the event in Avaniapuram features 1,000 registered bulls and 600 bull tamers. Madhav notes that 'No kind of any chemicals or drugs should not be used either by the bull tamer or on the bulls,' highlighting the strict medical tests and safety norms enforced following Supreme Court interventions. The report details the technicalities of the sport, where tamers must hold onto the bull's hump through the 'vadi vasal' entrance. As the state celebrates the harvest festival, the programme explores the cultural and spiritual significance of this annual athletic tradition, which remains a matter of deep faith for the people of Tamil Nadu."
