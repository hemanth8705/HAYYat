      "headline": "Live: Will sign executive order to enact 10% global tariff, Trump says after Supreme Court defeatUS Supreme Court Tariff Ruling Live updates: The US Supreme Court on Friday struck down President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, delivering a major setback to one of his most aggressive economic measures. In a 6-3 ruling authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court upheld a lower court's decision that Trump exceeded his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 to levy broad import taxes. While the IEEPA allows a president to regulate financial transactions and oversee imports and exports during a national emergency, it does not explicitly authorise the imposition of tariffs. The court noted that although past presidents have used the law to impose sanctions, Trump was the first to apply it to tariffs. Reacting sharply, Trump called the ruling a \"disgrace\" and said he has a backup plan. The tariffs had targeted multiple countries, including a steep 50 per cent duty on India, intensifying global trade tensions. Stay tuned with IndiaToday.in for the latest updates."
