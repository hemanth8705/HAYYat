The ICC has issued a firm ultimatum to Bangladesh, demanding confirmation by Wednesday, January 21, regarding their participation in the T20 World Cup hosted by India. Nikhil Naz notes, 'If you do not confirm your participation, then we will be forced to replace you with another team based on rankings.' The standoff follows the BCB's refusal to travel to India citing security concerns, a situation triggered after the BCCI reportedly requested an IPL franchise to drop Mustafizur Ahmed. While Bangladesh has proposed moving their matches to Sri Lanka or adopting a hybrid model, the ICC has rejected these alternatives. If Bangladesh fails to comply by the deadline, they risk being replaced by Scotland, marking an unprecedented logjam in international cricket history."
