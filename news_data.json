Shroff stated that when she began, women had to 'work twice as hard to prove that we are half as good as our male colleagues'. She recounted starting her practice in 1981, facing clients who refused to meet a woman lawyer and judges who were dismissive. A significant turning point came in 1991 when a client, for a matter in the Allahabad High Court, chartered a flight for her as she was unable to travel by train after a surgery. Shroff also discussed the challenges for women in the Indian judiciary, the existence of unconscious bias, the handling of an $11 billion deal by an all-women team, and her view that leadership means leading from the front with humility and compassion."
