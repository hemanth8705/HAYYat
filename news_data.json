The Opposition, which has already been disrupting proceedings demanding a debate on the Bihar issue, is expected to sharpen its attack on the government over its failure to clinch a trade deal with the US. The Opposition has pointed to the Prime Minister's repeated praise for his \"friend\" Donald Trump, questioning what that friendship has delivered amid rising economic pressure from Washington. India, in response, has said it remains committed to a fair and mutually beneficial trade agreement with the US - but emphasised that it would take all necessary steps to protect its farmers, MSMEs, and domestic entrepreneurs."
