The interim government said the funeral prayer will take place at the South Plaza of the National Parliament Building at 2 pm. Authorities also announced there will be no public viewing of the body and appealed to people to offer prayers while maintaining order. The body arrived in Dhaka from Singapore on Friday, following which the interim government urged citizens to resist violence by what it described as \"fringe elements\".

Despite the appeal, several areas witnessed attacks and vandalism on Thursday night, including stone-pelting at the residence of the Assistant Indian High Commissioner in Chattogram, shortly after Yunus confirmed Hadi's death.
