The shift comes after a stern warning from the ICC regarding potential sanctions, including the loss of PSL contracts and bilateral series. Nitin Srivastava notes, 'Pakistan was never in that kind of mind frame that they will boycott. It was just a threat to tell ICC that we can actually do that.' The transcript highlights that while Pakistan initially backed Bangladesh's protest against travelling to India, the fear of financial and sporting isolation forced a move toward compliance. While Bangladesh has been replaced by Scotland due to their refusal to play in India, Pakistan will play their matches in Colombo. The discussion underscores that the ICC will not tolerate 'petty politics' or moral support for boycotts that lack a valid security basis, ensuring the tournament proceeds with Pakistan's participation."

The tension escalated after the ICC replaced Bangladesh with Scotland, following Bangladesh's refusal to play in India. Vikrant Gupta notes, 'The moment they do that, their cricket is finished,' highlighting that Pakistan lacks a valid alibi for a boycott. The transcript details potential 'never-before sanctions' including the denial of NOCs for foreign players in the PSL, loss of ICC revenue, and total cricketing isolation. Gupta describes Pakistan's stance as 'geopolitical posturing' to align with Bangladesh, predicting that despite the current drama involving PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, Pakistan will ultimately participate in the tournament to avoid financial and institutional destruction."
