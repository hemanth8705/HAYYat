Speaking at the Berlin Global Dialogue, Mr. Goyal made it clear that India will not be rushed into agreements. He stated, 'we do not do deals in a hurry, and we do not go ahead and sign any deals with deadlines or with a gun to our head'.

This stance comes amid ongoing trade discussions with both the US and the European Union, where India is advocating for fair and equitable agreements that benefit its businesses and economy in the long run."
