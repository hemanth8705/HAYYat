The eruption triggered aviation warnings as the ash cloud drifted across the Red Sea toward Yemen and Oman. The disruption forced Akasa Air, IndiGo and KLM to cancel several flights on Monday. India's DGCA issued an advisory directing airlines to avoid all ash-affected areas and adjust routes, flight levels and fuel planning based on updated alerts. A plume from the eruption reached Delhi around 11 pm on Monday. Follow inidatoday.in for live updates."
