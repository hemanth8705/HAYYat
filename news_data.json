Wassan argues that targeting KKR co-owner Shah Rukh Khan for the franchise's initial bid for a Bangladeshi player is 'totally wrong' and 'unfair,' describing the actor as a 'low-hanging fruit' for public sentiment. He contends that while the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) may have taken the right step given the current 'political turmoil' and attacks on minorities in Bangladesh, removing a single player is merely 'shadow boxing' and will not solve the broader issues. The show, hosted by Nikhil Naz, also touches on the Bangladesh Cricket Board's request to move matches to Sri Lanka and the revocation of No Objection Certificates (NOCs) for players."

The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has officially requested the International Cricket Council (ICC) to move all of its T20 World Cup matches out of India, citing 'security threats to some of their players'. This development follows the recent controversy where Bangladeshi player Mustafizur Rahman was released by his IPL franchise, Kolkata Knight Riders, reportedly under pressure on the BCCI. The BCB's request mirrors a similar move by Pakistan, which has already arranged for its matches to be played in the tournament's joint-host nation, Sri Lanka. The ICC has not yet made a decision on the BCB's request to have its matches rescheduled in Sri Lanka."
