The pacer has publicly questioned his exclusion from the upcoming tour of Australia, stating that if he is fit enough to play four-day Ranji Trophy matches for Bengal, he should be considered for the 50-over format. This comes after Agarkar had reportedly raised concerns about Shami's lack of consistent match practice. Shami refutes any fitness concerns, asserting he is ready to play for the Indian team whenever called upon, creating a standoff between the veteran player and the national selectors."
