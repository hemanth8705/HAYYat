The programme discusses how toxic air quality is jeopardising India's bid for the 2036 Olympics, with Ahmedabad as the frontrunner. Joined by colleague Nikhil Naz, the discussion covers instances where international athletes, including badminton star Anders Antonsen, have raised alarms or refused to play in Delhi. The report further details how pollution affects athlete training, lung capacity, and the overall feasibility of hosting global events like the Commonwealth Games and the ODI World Cup.

The fallout of this decision is immediate, with Scotland set to replace Bangladesh as the highest-ranked non-qualified team. The report highlights that the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) lost an ICC board vote 14-2 regarding a venue change, with only Pakistan supporting them. Tensions reportedly escalated after the BCCI requested Kolkata Knight Riders to release Mustafizur Rahman. Despite the ICC providing security guarantees, the interim government cited 'genuine security risks' and a preference for the tournament to be moved to Sri Lanka. This marks the first time a team has boycotted an entire ICC tournament, leaving the future of Bangladesh cricket in a precarious position as the global tournament faces significant controversy."
