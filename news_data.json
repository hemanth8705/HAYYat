The programme discusses how toxic air quality is jeopardising India's bid for the 2036 Olympics, with Ahmedabad as the frontrunner. Joined by colleague Nikhil Naz, the discussion covers instances where international athletes, including badminton star Anders Antonsen, have raised alarms or refused to play in Delhi.
