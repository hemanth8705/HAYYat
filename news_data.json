      "headline": "Jemima redefined strength; it requires vulnerability to be strong: Dr. Shyam BhatPsychiatrist Dr. Shyam Bhat discusses the larger significance of cricketer Jemima Rodrigues' recent statements on mental health. Dr. Bhat states, 'she actually redefined what strength actually means...you should be in touch with your feelings. A certain vulnerability is required in order actually to be strong.' The conversation explores how Rodrigues represents a new generation that is more open about mental health challenges. Dr. Bhat also addresses why women are often more vocal about their struggles, the societal pressure on men to suppress vulnerability, and the shift in organisations towards valuing empathic leadership over traditional command-and-control structures. The interview highlights resilience, the importance of seeking support, and the changing narrative around mental wellness in India, both in sports and corporate life."
