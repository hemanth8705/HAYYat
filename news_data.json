The central question being investigated is, \"Was there a certain bribe that was paid to the banks to buy their silence?\" The ED has asked the banks to explain their inaction, especially when the loans turned into non-performing assets (NPAs). As the money laundering investigation mounts, Anil Ambani has been summoned to appear on the 5th of August. The ED has also summoned his top executives and close aides, including Amitabh Jhunjhunwala and Satish Seth, believing they hold key information on how the alleged frauds and payment of bribes occurred."
