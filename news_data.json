'Clearly the Jammu and Kashmir government rolled out the red carpet for the league without any background checks or verification process that's coming to the forefront at this point.' The scandal has left a trail of unpaid hotel bills amounting to tens of lakhs, with players and officials initially being prevented from leaving their hotel in Srinagar. While the J&K Sports Council, which had promoted the event and provided the Bakshi Stadium, has since tried to distance itself, questions are being raised about the lack of due diligence that allowed the fraudulent league to operate, tarnishing the region's image."
