'We just need the right to walk safely without looking over our shoulders,' one speaker emphasised, highlighting that safety is a right, not a form of protection. The conversation revealed that women hold less than 2% of jobs in the burgeoning gig economy, a stark contrast to their participation in the traditional economy. The panel also explored how urban infrastructure and product design often have a male-as-norm bias, from the height of bus handrails to the lack of pockets in women's clothing. The dialogue touched upon the 'pink tax' in transportation, where trip-chaining results in higher travel costs for women. The need for an enabling environment, including better public transport and services, was stressed as crucial for women's economic and social participation."

A woman leader recounted her early career in the late 90s, where she was told the company 'don't hire girls' and faced a lack of basic facilities like restrooms and proper safety gear in a factory setting. Another speaker addressed the issue of tokenism on corporate boards, suggesting that having three or more women in a group forms a cohort, whereas one is mere tokenism. The conversation delved into unconscious biases in hiring, noting that women's resumes are scrutinised for marital status more often than men's. The speakers emphasised that while policies like flexi-working exist, they can lead to subtle penalties and that a fundamental mindset shift, beyond just policy changes, is crucial for true gender equity in the workplace."
