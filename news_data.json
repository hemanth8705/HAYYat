In the last hearing on January 8, the bench highlighted the lack of proper implementation of ABC rules while also schooling dog lovers, including the counsel of actor Sharmila Tagore, who is one of the petitioners, of being \"far from reality\". The top court observed that dogs can smell fear in humans before attacking, a quote that quickly went viral. It also clarified that it has not directed the removal of all street dogs, but their treatment instead as per the ABC rules. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, one of the lawyers representing animal activists and dog lovers, urged the Supreme Court to involve domain experts while dealing with the case. Meanwhile, the bench refused to entertain cases of women dog feeders being harassed, asking them to file FIRs instead, while stressing that the court order was not a licence for harassment against anyone. The Supreme Court on November 7, 2025, directed the capture, sterilisation and permanent removal of all street dogs from educational institutions, hospitals, sports facilities, railway and bus stations. It had also directed the removal of stray cattle from these regions and highways. Stay tuned to indiatoday.in for the latest updates."
