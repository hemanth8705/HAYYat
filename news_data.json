Key changes include the removal of the 12% GST slab and rate rationalisation for health and life insurance policies.

The government is addressing concerns about inflation and the rising cost of living. Feedback regarding health insurance, which impacts the common person, has also been considered. The meetings in September are crucial for approving these changes, with implementation anticipated before Diwali. The Finance Ministry and state finance ministers have been involved in the process."
