The debate intensified as she also pointed fingers at India's head coach, Gautam Gambhir. The programme explores the political firestorm, featuring arguments from AIMIM's Waris Pathan, who highlighted Khan's exceptional domestic record and fitness improvements. Countering the allegations, former UP Minister Mohsin Raza condemned the politicization of cricket, reminding critics of India's history of Muslim captains and players. The discussion delves into whether Khan's exclusion is a matter of cricketing logic, as suggested by some, or a case of discrimination as alleged by opposition figures."
