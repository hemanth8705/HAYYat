The Lok Sabha has remained paralysed since Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi referred to an unpublished memoir of former Army chief General Manoj Naravane, drawing sharp objections from Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Home Minister Amit Shah. According to sources, Prime Minister Modi is likely to reply to the Motion of Thanks in the Rajya Sabha today, where discussion has concluded without disruption. The government is planning to get the Motion of Thanks passed in both Houses on the same day, even if the Lok Sabha debate does not resume normally. Sources also said that discussion on the Union Budget is expected to begin in the Lok Sabha today, even as uncertainty hangs over the smooth conduct of business amid the ongoing standoff.
