The proceedings focus on petitions highlighting the risks posed by stray animals and the alleged lapses of civic authorities in controlling them. On Wednesday, the bench sharply flagged non-compliance by municipal bodies, noting that fatalities in India were not solely due to dog bites but, also accidents caused by stray animals on roads.\u00a0 Observing that no one can predict an animal's \"mood to bite or not\", the bench stressed the principle that \"prevention is better than cure\". In November last year, the Supreme Court had ordered the removal of stray dogs from sensitive public spaces, including schools, hospitals, bus stands, sports complexes, and railway stations and directed that these animals be transferred to designated shelters.\u00a0Follow indiatoday.in for live updates."
