      "headline": "Women's workforce participation is very low; Kalpana Viswanath, CEO SafetipinIn a powerful discussion on women's rights and safety, a call was made for systemic change over waiting for patriarchal mindsets to shift. 'We just need the right to walk safely without looking over our shoulders,' one speaker emphasised, highlighting that safety is a right, not a form of protection. The conversation revealed that women hold less than 2% of jobs in the burgeoning gig economy, a stark contrast to their participation in the traditional economy. The panel also explored how urban infrastructure and product design often have a male-as-norm bias, from the height of bus handrails to the lack of pockets in women's clothing. The dialogue touched upon the 'pink tax' in transportation, where trip-chaining results in higher travel costs for women. The need for an enabling environment, including better public transport and services, was stressed as crucial for women's economic and social participation."

      "headline": "Fenesta CMO Susmita Nag discusses gender bias in hiring within professional workspacesA discussion highlights the stark reality for women in India's corporate sector, where they make up only 18% of the workforce in top NSE-listed companies. A woman leader recounted her early career in the late 90s, where she was told the company 'don't hire girls' and faced a lack of basic facilities like restrooms and proper safety gear in a factory setting. Another speaker addressed the issue of tokenism on corporate boards, suggesting that having three or more women in a group forms a cohort, whereas one is mere tokenism. The conversation delved into unconscious biases in hiring, noting that women's resumes are scrutinised for marital status more often than men's. The speakers emphasised that while policies like flexi-working exist, they can lead to subtle penalties and that a fundamental mindset shift, beyond just policy changes, is crucial for true gender equity in the workplace."

She recounted starting her practice in 1981, facing clients who refused to meet a woman lawyer and judges who were dismissive. A significant turning point came in 1991 when a client, for a matter in the Allahabad High Court, chartered a flight for her as she was unable to travel by train after a surgery. Shroff also discussed the challenges for women in the Indian judiciary, the existence of unconscious bias, the handling of an $11 billion deal by an all-women team, and her view that leadership means leading from the front with humility and compassion."
