      "headline": "Suryakumar bhai and I can perform the role of anchor if needed: Tilak VarmaHere's the full transcript of India batter Tilak Varma's press conference ahead of their February 12 match against Namibia in the T20 World Cup 2026. \r\n\r\n[Reporter:]\r\nTilak, what is the situation of Abhishek who was admitted to the hospital? Is he fine? Is he still in the hospital, or is he with the team at the hotel?\r\n\r\n[Tilak Verma:]\r\nWhen we reached Delhi, he went for some examinations at the hospital. I think he has been discharged today, and he's doing well. We still have one more day before the game, so hopefully we'll decide by tomorrow how he feels and then move forward accordingly.\r\n\r\n[Reporter:]\r\nWhen you play against less experienced teams, their field placements, bowling speeds, and shot selections can be different. Does that make it difficult for teams like India to adjust? What adjustments do you have to make?\r\n\r\n[Tilak Verma:]\r\nEspecially with these newer teams, you can't take anyone lightly. You saw that in the last match. It wasn't that we took them lightly, but we didn't read the conditions properly. After that, Surya bhai came in and played a great innings, which helped the team a lot.\r\nAt the same time, we should always back our basics and play our best game. Whatever the field or situation, you have to read it ball by ball. T20 cricket is a very short format\u2014anything can happen, and any team can beat anyone. So it's important to bring your A-game in every match.\r\n\r\n[Reporter:]\r\nYesterday it was said that Jasprit Bumrah had started bowling again after 10 days. He was in the nets for quite a long time. What is the update on him? Will he be available for tomorrow's game?\r\n\r\n[Tilak Verma:]\r\nHe is absolutely fine now. He's doing better. As I said, we still have one more day, so hopefully he'll be back in the team. If he continues to improve, the team management will take a call, and I think he could be back for the second game.\r\n\r\n[Reporter:]\r\nTilak bhai, tomorrow there's a match, and after that, another big one in Colombo. There has been a lot of discussion around it. As a player, what were you thinking? Was there any discussion about whether you would play or not?\r\n\r\n[Tilak Verma:]\r\nNo, sir. To be honest, we're actually excited to play now. We found out that the match is going to happen, and we were already preparing for it. We've been watching the opposition, studying their bowlers, and preparing as batsmen.\r\nWhen we heard the match would be played, all the players and staff were excited. We're in match mode now, and the planning has started.\r\n\r\n[Reporter:]\r\nCan you talk about your comeback from injury, playing at number three, and your new role compared to what you were doing before?\r\n\r\n[Tilak Verma:]\r\nYes, sir. I'm really happy to be back in the World Cup squad. I worked hard over the last two or three weeks and followed good routines. God has been kind, and I returned to the field quickly.\r\nMy aim is to help the team win the World Cup. I'm ready for whatever role the team wants from me. I've always said I'm ready to bat wherever the team needs me. I'm prepared for any role, and I'm looking forward to it.\r\n\r\n[Reporter:]\r\nWhen you were declared fit and started playing the warm-up games, Surya said you've come back as a better player with a stronger mindset. What was your mindset during rehab? Did the break help you reset before the big tournament?\r\n\r\n[Tilak Verma:]\r\nFirst of all, if I have to sit for a couple of days without a bat in my hands, I feel very strange. It feels like I'm in a different world.\r\nEvery night before sleeping, I visualize playing in big matches, even the World Cup final, and putting myself under pressure. It's a habit from childhood. I've been playing for so many years that these thoughts come naturally before I sleep.\r\nSo I don't worry about breaks. My mind stays in the same positive zone. I keep preparing mentally. I didn't feel like I was out of the game because of injury. I stayed in the zone, focused on winning matches, and reacted to the situations when I returned.\r\n\r\n[Reporter:]\r\nIn tomorrow's match and the one in Ahmedabad, do you want to experiment to find the perfect combination before the Super 8?\r\n\r\n[Tilak Verma:]\r\nThere is still time before the Super 8 and the final. We have to go match by match. First, we will focus on tomorrow's match.\r\nThe main thing is what we can do well in that game. So we'll think about that and approach the match accordingly. If everything goes well, the rest will take care of itself.\r\n\r\n[Reporter:]\r\nAfter the openers, it's often said that the batting positions from three to five will be flexible. How do you look at your batting position? Are you preparing for different roles?\r\n\r\n[Tilak Verma:]\r\nAs I said, I'm ready to play in any position. But I believe the middle overs are very important and should be handled by a settled batsman.\r\nI try to take the game deep, especially when we are chasing. We have a lot of power-hitters all the way down to number eight, so someone needs to anchor the innings in the middle overs. I take that responsibility on myself.\r\nEvery match is different\u2014the wicket, the conditions, the bowlers. Even against the same team, every day is different. So I focus on the present and react to the situation instead of thinking too far ahead.\r\n\r\n[Reporter:]\r\nGoing back to the Mumbai game, was the collapse more about reading the conditions or shot selection? How did it become 77 for 6?\r\n\r\n[Tilak Verma:]\r\nTo be honest, at the start, when Abhishek got out, I went in and felt the ball was coming nicely onto the bat. I thought the wicket was fine, but actually it wasn't. I was just in that flow.\r\nUnfortunately, it happens. People also felt it was playing well. But after a few wickets fell, we realized we had assessed the pitch a bit late. We had one or two soft dismissals as well.\r\nBut the way Surya played was a masterclass. That's the strength of this team. We haven't lost a bilateral series because someone always takes responsibility. That's a big sign. In this tournament, especially in the Super 8 or knockouts, such innings will be crucial.\r\n\r\n[Reporter:]\r\nMost of the players were champions in 2024, but for some, including you, this is the first World Cup. What's different about playing your first World Cup, especially in India?\r\n\r\n[Tilak Verma:]\r\nFirst of all, it's a dream. Playing a World Cup in home conditions is very special. Starting the first match at Wankhede was also special. Not every cricketer gets to experience that.\r\nAt the same time, there is pressure because everyone expects you to win at home. We saw the support from the crowd in the last match. So there are expectations and pressure, but also strong support.\r\nThere are advantages and disadvantages, but we've been handling pressure since childhood. We're enjoying it now, and we'll see how it goes.\r\n\r\n[Reporter:]\r\nIndia vs Pakistan is coming up. Pakistan's spinners are doing well in Colombo. What is your preparation and mindset for that match?\r\n\r\n[Tilak Verma:]\r\nWe're taking it one match at a time. We'll use video analysis and technology to study their bowlers and the conditions. We've already started preparing.\r\nWe have all kinds of shots in our team, so depending on the wicket and the situation, we'll decide whether to attack or play accordingly. We'll pick the best team for the conditions and go from there.\r\n\r\n[Reporter:]\r\nThere was talk earlier that only the top two positions were fixed, with flexibility after that. But now it seems like you and Surya are set at three and four. What has changed?\r\n\r\n[Tilak Verma:]\r\nWorld Cups come with high expectations and pressure. We've done well at numbers three and four. In those positions, we can find gaps and rotate the strike.\r\nOur openers are aggressive, and we have powerful hitters down the order. So the middle overs become very important. I believe the team that performs well between overs 6 and 16 usually wins the match.\r\nThat's why Surya and I are taking responsibility in those positions\u2014to manage the pressure and set things up for the finishers. That's the plan we've discussed.\r\n\r\n[Reporter:]\r\nAfter the difficult batting performance against the USA, what did the head coach say in the dressing room?\r\n\r\n[Tilak Verma:]\r\nTo be honest, Gautam sir didn't say much. He said it happens once in a while. In pressure situations, we gave away a couple of wickets. He told us we should read the conditions earlier.\r\nWe usually play with an aggressive approach, but when wickets fall, sometimes we need to hold back for a couple of overs before accelerating again, especially considering our batting depth.\r\nHe said he would back whatever we decided as players, and that we should continue playing with the same intensity. That was the main message."
